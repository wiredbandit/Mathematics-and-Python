# Mathematics-and-Python

I'm planning on using this space to store various Python scripts as I 
work through the book "Mathematics and Python Programming" by J.C. Bautista

These are not my creations, but my aim is to use the book to further my Python skills,
learn Github, and flesh out some kind of coding portfolio.
